# Call Management System - Business Report

## Project Objective
As per the request of a major travel company, our team has been given the opportunity to develop an information system which will aim to improve the daily operations of the company's in-house call management centre (CMS). Moreover, our development team's purpose is to examine the current business processes currently in place within the company and analyse what aspects of the system is to be changed as per the stakeholders request. By finding out the problems of the current processes of the business, our team will be able to brainstorm viable solutions which will improve efficiency and effectiveness of the CMS.

- Improve current business processes of the call routing system.
- Improve relationship manager to customer profile matching system.
- Create a visual interface for users to go along with the phone system.
- Reduce wait times of customers.

## Problem Definition
The major travel company is looking to implement a system which will utilise a "profiling tool" to match relationship managers with the appropriate customer. Additionally, the current business processes of the major travel company does not have a means of setting up the right relationship manager with the appropriate customer which is causing the company to lose sales as customers are left dissatisfied. Furthermore, the current business processes of the travel company lacks the ability to cater to a large number of customers at a given period which is forcing many customers to be put in queue with wait times. With many customers unsatisfied with the wait times and being paired with a relationship manager with a low similarity index, customers are left unsatisfied leading to decreased sales success and efficiency. In order to improve the current business processes of the travel company, the system which handles all in-bound and out-bound calls needs to be improved to reduce customer dissatisfaction rates.

## Stakeholders
- CMC Company Manager
- Relationship Managers
- Profile specialists
- Customers
- Flight agencies

## Assumptions of current business processes
- One phone number for the entire travel company
- All in-bound calls are redirected to the profile specialists sector which asks the caller a set of questions regarding background, culture and preferred destination.
- All out-bound calls made have been determined by the profile specialists to match the profile of the relationship manager making the call with a customer of similar profile.
- Current customers are able to be connected directly to the support relationship manager by stating their identification code.
- Information (profile and skills matrix) of registered customers and hired employees are kept in the central database of the company.
- Customer scores are recorded by the corresponding relationship manager and are saved into the database.
- All in-bound calls ask the customer for their identification code, this will be used to access their sales score and be put into a priority queue (high scores) or standard queue (low scores).
- The current "Profile Tool" used only takes into account an individual's surname and residential postcode.
- All employees are required to complete 2 forms; a profile questionnaire and a skills/expertise questionnaire. This is done upon being hired by the travel company.
- A relationship manager's skills/expertise may be subjected to re-evaluation if sales performance is decreasing.
- During busy periods, in-bound calls may be transferred to the first available relationship manager. Relationship manager and customer pair may not have matching profiles but are skilled in the destination of choice.
- Customers are able to opt out of the queue during busy periods but will lose their place in the queue.

## Point of View Statements
### CMC Company Manager
- Customer's working busy lives don't have time to research and plan vacations during holidays. Customers need to be directly shown what they want to reduce the stress of actually finding what they desire.
### Profile Specialists
- With numerous customers looking to consult with a travel specialist on a given destination, they need to be catered to in the quickest possible time frame so that they do not need to waste time on researching their destination themselves.
### Relationship Managers
- Customer's will find it difficult to be satisfied with sales pitches because they don't trust the other person on the phone. They need to be given the opportunity to trust who they are talking to so that they engage with the sales pitch.
### Customers
- Call centre salesmen/saleswomen make sales pitches sound boring and un-enticing because the person making the call sounds like a generic, automated response. Salespeople need to clearly engage with the customer so that I don't get the impression that the sales pitch is scripted.

# How to Solve HMW ? 
## CMC Company managers
1. Sales can be improved by better profiling of both customer and RMs, improving call routes and rates, creating customer scorecard and feedback reports, increasing numbers of inbound and outbound call handling.
2. RM's sales pitch success is driven by skill matcher and profiling tools within the system which will lead to more success rate in terms of sales turnover.
3. Customers might be holding back maybe because of getting less value for their holiday package, mainly little integration and engagement by the company's RM's or profile specialists.
4. Increased customer satisfaction through more engaging behaviour by the employees of the firm and also providing best deals which customers demand through extensive knowledge of RMs.
## Relationship managers
1. Improve sales pitch by empathizing with customers needs and providing the exact package that clients are looking for.
2. Framing and asking improved quality of questions in order to get what are customer needs and targeting exact points which customers were looking to get answers for would make a good sales tactic impression.
3. If the sales pitch is too generic and automated/robotic and seems like it's made to just focus on sales and not connecting with the customers, the company is more likely to lose sales.
4. The typical RM matching method which uses customers surname and postcodes lags the ability to know the client better and thefore makes the RM incompetent when it comes to knowing the full profile of the customer. 
5. By creating a better customer profile through improved quality of questionnaire, customer responses could be improved.
## Profile specialists
1. Time frame could be reduced by first contacting potential clients and then handling the other customers by gathering information specifically centered at their needs and wants thereby wasting less time on unimportant questions.
2. RMs and customers can be linked via a profiling tool and skill set system which will make the best pair of the customer and RM making the CMC operation efficient.
3. Questions like customer's age, sex, cultural background, travel and budget prefrences, duration choices, traditional choices, etc.
## Customers
1. Customer's need specific questions can be asked and RM empathizing will make customers feel more engaged and interested and more willing to consider opting this company.
2. With the 'profiling tool' and 'skill matcher' the perfect match of RM and customer will be made so that there is efficiency and time-saving in service.
3. By improving the CMC operating system, customers will not spend more than 10-15 minutes on call as their goal specific questions and queries will be solved.

# Reflection on finding and solving HMW
These HMW statements were brainstormed and thought about based on the POV statements that focuses on end-user's needs and problems. Taking the basis of assumptions and POV statements HMW statements determine the problems that each stakeholder could potentially face and also find solutions to those problems were a part of this process. HMW statements helped how each stakeholder can be made more efficient by assessing their needs and problems and systematically finding solutions to those issues.

## Competitive Advantages of the new Information System Project
The call flow between RM's and customers will greatly improve after implementing this new IS system because now the profile specialists will effectively match the customers with RM's in respect to RM's skills and knowledge and customer's specific interest in the holiday package. This will ultimately lead to increased sales for travel agencies as RM's will have higher chances of converting potential customers into sales as they will focus on specific customer issues in selecting holiday packages and thus try to connect more with clients.

RM's will be benefiting from this system most because now they can be more prepared to answer customer queries in a more effective and efficient manner to their own best knowledge and ability due to the profile matching method used by the new system. With help of profile specialists matching the customer and RM, it is less likely for a RM to get customers with issues which are not in their area of expertise and knowledge. When Customer issues are solved by a RM, then the customer would be redirected to appropriate RM who can solve their issues.

Customers are the ones who are most likely to benefit from this new IS as they will be able to match with the RM who can relate and empathize with their situation and provide substantial insights into their problems thus giving customers better understanding and guidance in selecting the best holiday package. Only those RM's with more experience with customer's interest specific holiday packages will be assigned to them so that the RM can go through the holiday package in a way which a customer can understand in a thorough manner.

## Possible adverse effects of the new Information System Project if it fails
When a company looks to invest in developing or improving a current system within the business, the new or improved system will always have adverse effects upon release which could jeopardize the current business processes. With regard to our team's current project development of a call management system, our developed software solutions aims to completely control and handle all the current Travel companies call routing and relationship manager to customer pairing.

If the newly developed system fails to achieve its purpose of managing all in-bound and out-bound calls of the Travel company, it could result in a large number of customers being put into a waiting queue and forcing customers to wait long queue times due to the company’s lacking ability to re-route calls efficiently. With a large number of callers expected to call the company at any given time, a failing system would drastically reduce the amount of calls relationship managers are able to take as more time would be spent rerouting and organising calls to appropriate relationship managers.

Another possible adverse effect the system may have on the Travel agency may be the inaccurate pairing of the customers to a corresponding relationship manager with similar profile attributes. In the event that the company is unable to utilise the new system, profile specialists would need to take over the re-routing of calls to similarly scored customers which will result in customers being given waiting times to ensure the appropriate relationship manager is paired to a customer. However, an opposite event may occur where a customer is rushed to the first available relationship manager which ultimately adds to the company’s initial troubles.

Ultimately, both instances result in customers leaving dissatisfied with the service they received which would cause the company to decrease in sales and lose their relationship with existing customers.
