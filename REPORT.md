# Call Management System - Business Report

## Project Objective
As per the request of a major travel company, our team has been given the opportunity to develop a information system which will aim to improve the daily operations of the companies in-house call management centre (CMS). Moreover, our development team's purpose is to examine the current business processes currently in place within the company and analyse what aspects of the system is to be changed as per the stakeholders request. By finding out the problems of the current processes of the business, our team will be able to brainstorm viable solutions which will improve effeciency and effectiveness of the CMS.

- Improve current business processes of the call routing system.
- Improve relationship manager to customer profile matching system.
- Create a visual interface for users to go along with phone system.
- Reduce wait times of customers.

## Problem Definition
The major travel company is looking to implement a system which will utilise a "profiling tool" to match relationship managers with the appropriate customer. Additionally, the current business processes of the major travel company does not have a means of settings up the right relationship manager with the appropriate customer which is causing the company to lose sales as customers are left dissatisfied. Furthermore, the current business processes of the travel company lacks the ability to cater to a large amount of customers at a given period which is forcing many customers to be put in queue with wait times. With many customers unsatifised with the wait times and being pair with a relationship manager with a low similarity index, customers are left unsatisfied leading to decreased sale success and effeciency. In order to improve the current business processes of the travel company, the system which handles all in-bound and out-bound calls needs to be improved to reduce customer unsatisfaction rates.

## Stakeholders
- CMC Company Manager
- Relationship Managers
- Profile specialists
- Customers
- Flight agencies
- System Administrators

## Assumptions of current business processes
- One phone number for the entire travel company
- All in-bound calls are redirected to profile specialists sector which asks the caller a set a questions regarding background, culture and preferred destination.
- All out-bound calls made have been determined by the profile specialists to match the profile of the relationship manager making the call with a customer of similar profile.
- Current customers are able to be connected directly to support relationship manager by stating their identification code.
- Information (profile and skills matrix) of registered customers and hired employees are kept in the central database of the company.
- Customer scores are recored by the corresponding relationship manager and is saved into the database.
- All in-bound calls ask the customer for their identification code, this will be used to access their sales score and be put into a priority queue (high scores) or standard queue (low scores).
- The current "Profile Tool" used only takes into account an individuals surname and residential postcode.
- All employees are required to complete 2 forms; a profile questionnaire and a skills/expertise questionnaire. This is done upon being hired by the travel company.
- A relationship managers skills/expertise may be subjected to re-evaluation if sales performance is decreasing.
- During busy periods, in-bound calls may be transferred to first available relationship manager. Relationship manager and customer pair may not have matching profiles but are skilled in destination of choice.
- Customers are able to opt out of queue during busy periods but will lose their place in queue.

## Point of View Statements
### CMC Company Manager
- Customer's working busy lives dont have time to research and plan vacations during holidays. Customers need to be directly shown what they want to reduce the stress of actually finding what they desire.
### Profile Specialists
- With numerous customers looking to consult with a travel specialist on a given destination, they need to be catered to in the quickest possible time frame so that do not need to waste time on researching their destination themselves.
### Relationship Managers
- Customer's will find it difficult to be satisfied with sales pitches because they dont trust the other person on the phone. They need to be given the opportunity to trust who theyre talking to so that they engage with the sales pitch.
### Customers
- Call centre salesmen/saleswomen make sales pitches sound boring and unenticing because the person making the call sounds like a generic, automated response. Salespeople need to clearly engaged with the customer so that I dont get the impression that the sales pitch it scripted.

# How to Solve HMW ? 
## CMC Company managers
1. Sales can improved by better profiling of both customer and RMs, improving call routes and rates, creating customer score card and feedback reports, increasing numbers of invound and outbound call handling.
2. RM's sales pitch success is driven by skill matcher and profiling tool within the system which will lead to more success rate in terms of sales turnover.
3. Customers might be holding back maybe because of getting less value for thier holiday package, mainly little integration and engagement by the comapany's RM's or profile specialists.

## Relationship managers
1. Improve sales pitch by empathizing with customers needs and providing the exact package what clients are looking for.

3. If the sales pitch is too generic and automated/robotic and seems like its made to just focus on sales and not connecting with the customers, the company is more likely to loose sales.
4. The typical RM matching method which uses customers surname and postcodes lags the ability to know the client better and thefore makes the RM incompetent when it comes to knowing the full profile of the customer. 
5. By creating better customer profile through improved quality of questionnarie, customer responses could be improved.
## Profile specialists
1. Time frame could be reduced by first contacting potential clients and then handle the other customers by gathering information specifically centered at their needs and wants thereby wasting less time on unimportant questions.
2. RMs and customers can be linked via a profiling tool and skill set system which will make best pair of the customer and RM making the CMC operation efficient.
3. Questions like customer's age, sex, cultural background, travel and budget prefrences, duration choices, traditional choices, etc.
## Customers
1. Customer's need specific questions can be asked and RM empathizing will make customers feelk more engaged and interested and more willing to consider opting this company.

## Identify and discuss the possible adverse effects for this Business if this information system project fails
When a company looks to invest in developing or improving a current system within the business, the new or improved system will always have adverse effects upon release which could jeapordise the current business processes. With regard to our teams current project development of a call management system, our developed software solutions aims to completely control and handle all the current Travel companies call routing and relationship manager to customer pairing.

A possible adverse effect the new system could bring to the company is a larger influx of customer calls, while this may sound like a possible benefit a larger customer input could result in increased wait times and queues for customers due to the lack of relationship managers the company can provide. While one of the aims of this software development is to reduce the queues and waiting times customers experience, this possible risk would only add to the current issues of the business rather than solving it. Thereby, cuasing reduce sales and decreased customer satisfaction.

Another possible adverse effect the system may have on the Travel agency may be the inaccurate pairing of the customers to a corresponding relationship manager with similar profile attributes. Eloborating on this impact, customers who look to consult a relationship manager with high expertise in a chosen destination, only to be paired with a relationship manager with little knowledge could result in a decrease of sales. Although, ensuring a customer is paired with a relationship manager with a similar profile score is a key aspect of the system, it may cause customers to lose trust in the company gain a sense of inappropriate racial profiling as a means of increasing company sales.
