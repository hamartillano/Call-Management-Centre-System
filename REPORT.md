## Problem Definition
The major travel company is looking to implement a system which will utilise a "profiling tool" to match relationship managers with the appropriate customer. Additionally, the current business processes of the major travel company does not have a means of settings up the right relationship manager with the appropriate customer which is causing the company to lose sales as customers are left dissatisfied. Furthermore, the current business processes of the travel company lacks the ability to cater to a large amount of customers at a given period which is forcing many customers to be put in queue with wait times. With many customers unsatifised with the wait times and being pair with a relationship manager with a low similarity index, customers are left unsatisfied leading to decreased sale success and effeciency. In order to improve the current business processes of the travel company, the system which handles all in-bound and out-bound calls needs to be improved to reduce customer unsatisfaction rates.

- Current customers are able to be connected directly to support relationship manager by stating their identification code.
- Information (profile and skills matrix) of registered customers and hired employees are kept in the central database of the company.
- Customer scores are recored by the corresponding relationship manager and is saved into the database.
- All in-bound calls ask the customer for their identification code, this will be used to access their sales score and be put into a priority queue (high scores) or standard queue (low scores).
- The current "Profile Tool" used only takes into account an individuals surname and residential postcode.
- All employees are required to complete 2 forms; a profile questionnaire and a skills/expertise questionnaire. This is done upon being hired by the travel company.
- A relationship managers skills/expertise may be subjected to re-evaluation if sales performance is decreasing.
- During busy periods, in-bound calls may be transferred to first available relationship manager. Relationship manager and customer pair may not have matching profiles but are skilled in destination of choice.
- Customers are able to opt out of queue during busy periods but will lose their place in queue.

## Point of View Statements

### Customers
